            <h3>How will people around the world be affected by rising sea levels due to global climate change?</h3>
            <p>This is a project that is for upper level high school students in history or social studies class. This class project is made in connection
                with the project <a href="https://james914581.wixsite.com/cohort7chinacrewcomm">Community Climate Action.</a> Both of these projects are made
                for Moreland University teacher certification program.

            <h1>Learning objectives</h1>
            <h3>Students will work in groups of four</h3>
            <p>Students will learn about the geoprahic regions that will be affected by the rising sea levels. Within these regions
                the students will choose a group of people that calls this region their home. The group will then learn about the history of this group.
                In addition to this, they will learn about what is being done to help these populations to prepare for the incoming difficulties.
                By the end of this project the groups will create a social media campaign that will inform the public about these groups of people and how
                they can be helped.

                    <p>Students will need to work as a group to create their final social media campaign. Furthermore, they will  need to
                        talk about how they will do the research and divide the work. Finally, The students will need to create a message for their
                        campaigns.

                        these people in need. Students will need to be able to explain how their ideas to help the populations they chose.

                        want to make YouTube or TikTok videos. Or will they create a campaign around using AR apps and geotagging. Students will get many opportunites to use
                        a variety of technology in this project.

                    They might also need to learn about zoological and ecological science that would be connected to the food or fresh water
                    sources that the people might need to survive.

                    the students can make for creating their social media campaign can allow students to demonstrate, learn, and grow in artistic expression.

                        project giving feedback when necessary. After the research stage has finished, teacher will have students give an update to the teacher, which will be followed
                        by teacher feedback and suggestions. As these are high school students, the teacher wants to remain as hands off as possible when monitoring students progress.

                        criticism of the project. While working on the project, the teacher will provide suggestions if the students get stuck or are unsure how to use certain social media technologies.
                        If needed, the teacher can provide links to YouTube videos that provide extra tutorials on how to build infographics, edit video, make AR geotags and so on.
